# Exit through the Dungeon

This is my second attempt to create a small PICO-8 game.

The idea for the game came up as part of a conversation I had with my kids while playing the first attempt I did creating a game on the PICO-8 fantasy console. The idea is that you will play as either one of my kids (they are twins by the way), where the goal is find the other, unlock the door with a key, and then find the exit of the dungeon before getting caught by the rock monster in the game.

Other ideas are to have 3 difficulties (easy, normal, hard), where on easy the player will see the entire layout of the dungeon, on normal the player will only see what is around or in front of them (representing flash light), and on hard the player needs to recharge the flash light by finding batteries scattered throughout the dungeon.

To start the game, I usually just run PICO-8 from the terminal using the run command:

```
pico8 -run ettd.p8
```

The end goal would be to have something I could eventually release on itch.io, but TBH the actual goal is just to have some fun with my kids playing a game we co-created together.
